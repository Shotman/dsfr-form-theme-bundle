## How to use this form theme:

This form theme was built to work with Twig in combination with the Symfony Framework. 

The easiest way to make use of this form theme in Symfony is just to copy the form theme file (dsfr-form-theme.html.twig) somewhere in the templates folder of your project.

But the best way is to install this form theme and set it in the configuration file. Have a look at the [Symfony documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/form/form_customization.html#making-application-wide-customizations). Also example files are provided in this repository.
This way you will benefit of this package update with Composer.
